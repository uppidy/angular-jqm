<div jqm-page>
    <h1>Pages and transitions</h1>

    <h2><code>jqmViewport</code></h2>
    The <code>jqmViewport</code> directive defines the element under which
    the mobile pages are added. This automatically adds <code>ng-view</code> to it.

    <h2>Page transitions</h2>

    <p><em>Defining animations for pages</em></p>
    <p>
    Every route can have the extra property <code>transition</code> with the name of the transition to use
    when going to that page. Transition names: E.g. <code>slide</code>, ... (all transitions of jqm are supported).
    </p>

    <p><em>Integration with browser history</em></p>
    <p>
    When going back using the browser back button, the transition that was used to show the page is
    played backwards, ignoring the <code>transition</code> property of the page that is about to be shown.
    This is the same behavior as in jqm.
    </p>

    <p><em>Feature detection</em></p>
    <p>
    Browsers that don't support 3d animations, all complex transitions (like <code>pop</code>) fall back to the <code>slide</code> transition.
    This is the same behavior as in jqm.
    </p>

    <h2>Cached views</h2>
    <p>
    The <code>angular-jqm</code> projects adds caching to angular views (<code>ng-view</code>).
    Cached views allow to cache views including their scopes using the <code>$jqmViewCache</code> service.
    By this, changing views with routes gets very fast as there is no need to recompile them on every visit.
    </p>

    <p>
    To make this work the semantics of routes were changed a little:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a route for a cached template is activated, the template and it's scope are taken from the cache.
        If the template is not yet cached, it is compiled and then added to the cache.</li>
    <li>If a route is left, it's scope is disconnected, if it's activated, the scope gets reconnected.</li>
    <li>All templates that are in the <code>$templateCache</code> service are compiled with a new disconnected scope
        on startup.</li>
    <li>
        Route controllers are created only on the first time it's route is activated.
        Afterwards, they may listen to the <code>$viewContentLoaded</code> event to be notified that
        their route is activated again.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
